Practice with Spotify API and Python
Behold …

I, king of the world, the greatest Python programmer in history, have succeed in the following. I wrote a script that does this wicked coolness using the Spotify API:

    Creates and opens an HTML file then inserts some opening skeleton tags
    Takes an artist ID
    Gets that artist’s albums
        For each album
            puts the album title in
            tags
            inserts
            uses the album ID to get that album’s tracks
                For each track
                    puts the track name in
                    tags
            inserts

    inserts some closing skeleton tags and closes the HTML file
