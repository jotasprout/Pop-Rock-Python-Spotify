# myRockinApp
Python script using the SpotifyWebAPI to get data about an artist, their albums, and those albums' songs to store in a MySQL database and track popularity over time as well as comparing popularity to similar data from other artists/albums/songs.

## Status
Abandoned.

Moved on to [myRockinApp](https://github.com/jotasprout/myRockinApp) (Javascript), then [Pop-PHP](https://github.com/jotasprout/Pop-PHP) (PHP and MySQL) because I couldn't get the objects to build as completely as I wanted.
